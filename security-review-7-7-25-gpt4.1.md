# Security Review: Weather Synth Repository (security-review-gpt4-1)

**Date:** 7 July 2025

---

## 1. Dependency Security
- All dependencies in `package.json` are reputable and up-to-date.
- No secrets or sensitive data are present in dependency files.
- `npm audit` should be run regularly to detect and address vulnerabilities.

## 2. Secrets & Sensitive Data
- No secrets or API keys are hardcoded in the codebase.
- `.env.example` and `terraform.tfvars.example` use placeholders and instruct users not to commit real secrets.
- Sensitive values (API keys, tokens) are loaded from environment variables, which is best practice.

## 3. Code Security
- API keys are accessed via `process.env` and not exposed in the code.
- No use of dangerous functions like `eval`, `innerHTML`, or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- `fetch` is used only for trusted APIs (OpenWeatherMap, LaunchDarkly).
- `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are used for non-sensitive data (user/session IDs).
- Error reporting to LaunchDarkly includes the current URL, but not user PII or secrets.

## 4. Configuration Files
- No secrets are present in versioned config files.
- `.env.example` and `terraform.tfvars.example` remind users not to commit real secrets.

## 5. Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform)
- Sensitive variables (e.g., `launchdarkly_access_token`) are marked as `sensitive = true`.
- No secrets are hardcoded in Terraform files.
- The provider is configured to use variables, not plaintext.

## 6. Other Observations
- No evidence of XSS, SQL injection, or similar vulnerabilities.
- No use of cookies for authentication or sensitive data.
- No CORS or CSP headers are set in this codebase (should be handled by deployment/server).

## Recommendations

1. **Run `npm audit` regularly** and address any vulnerabilities.
2. **Never commit real `.env` or `terraform.tfvars` files** with secrets.
3. **Review error reporting** to ensure no sensitive user data is sent to third parties.
4. **Consider adding a security.txt** or similar policy file for responsible disclosure.
5. **If deploying publicly, set appropriate HTTP security headers** (CSP, HSTS, etc.) at the server or CDN level.
